# K-Means-clustering
This repository contains code for performing K-Means Clustering in Python.

Overview
K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm used to partition a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping clusters.

Getting Started
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the cloned directory.

Dependencies
This code requires the following Python packages:

NumPy
Matplotlib
Instructions
Load the dataset
Initialize K centroids
Repeat until convergence: a. Assign each data point to the closest centroid b. Compute new centroids based on the assignments
Documentation
For more information, see the Jupyter notebook K-Means Clustering.ipynb.
